# Vulnerability-scanner-
This Python script serves as a basic vulnerability scanner by scanning for open ports on a specified target system. It employs the `socket` library to establish connections with a range of ports on the provided IP address. Each port is probed for accessibility, and if a connection is successful, indicating an open port, it's recorded. The scanner outputs a list of these open ports, which can be potential entry points for further investigation or exploitation. While this tool offers a fundamental capability for identifying accessible network services, it lacks the sophistication of more comprehensive vulnerability scanners. Enhancing its functionality could involve incorporating additional features such as service version detection, vulnerability database integration, and reporting capabilities. As with any security tool, it's essential to use it responsibly, ensuring compliance with legal and ethical standards to avoid unauthorized access or harm to systems.
